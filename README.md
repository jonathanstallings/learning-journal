# learning-journal
This project was created as part of the pre-work for the [Code Fellows Python Development Accelerator](https://www.codefellows.org/development-accelerators/).

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) was used to facilitate stylesheet creation, and effort was made towards a responsive design. Although no CSS frameworks are used directly, inspiration for the CSS organization was heavily inspired by [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).

Built on the [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) web framework, this learning journal will list recent entries in descending order. Authorized users can add and edit existing entries.
