        <p>This project was created as part of the pre-work for the <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/development-accelerators/">Code Fellows Python Development Accelerator</a>.</p>
        <p>Currently this stands as a mockup for style and layout purposes. <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> was used to facilitate stylesheet creation, and effort was made towards a responsive design. Although no CSS frameworks are used directly, inspiration for the CSS organization was heavily inspired by <a href="http://getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a>.</p>
        <p>More details will be added as this project is developed.</p>
